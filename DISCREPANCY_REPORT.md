## Content Audit Summary

| File Pair | Discrepancy Level | Missing Content % | Action Required |
|-----------|------------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Session 1 | HIGH | 30% | Add 3 exercises, 1 bloc |
| Session 3 | HIGH | 25% | Add 1 exercise, features |
| Session 4 | HIGH | 35% | Add plastic surgery content |
| Session 3 Exercises | CRITICAL | 100% | Complete replacement |
| Session 4 Exercises | CRITICAL | 80% | Major content update |
| Programme | MEDIUM | 15% | Add manifesto, links |

---

## Conclusion

The HTML files are significantly outdated compared to their MD counterparts. The most critical issues are:

1. Session 3 & 4 exercise files need complete replacement
2. All session files missing 25-35% of content
3. Advanced features (Perplexity Labs, thinking modes) not documented
4. Plastic surgery specific content largely absent

Recommended approach: Use MD files as authoritative source and systematically update all HTML files to match.
