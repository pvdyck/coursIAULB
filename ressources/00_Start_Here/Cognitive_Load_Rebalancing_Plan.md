# 🧠 Cognitive Load Rebalancing Plan
## AI Medical Training Program Redesign

### 🎯 **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

**ULTIMATE GOAL**: Transform student TFE (thesis) into publishable international journal article using AI tools.

The current 4-session program suffers from **critical cognitive overload**, particularly in Sessions 1-2. This plan restructures the training using evidence-based learning science principles to build **systematic publication competency** - ensuring every student can transform their TFE into Nature/Science-level publication.

## 📊 **CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS**

### **Major Cognitive Load Violations:**

1. **Session 1**: **CRITICAL OVERLOAD** 
   - 4 platforms introduced simultaneously 
   - Advanced features before basic mastery
   - Excessive context switching (every 5-10 min)
   - Premature comparative analysis

2. **Session 2**: **HIGH OVERLOAD**
   - Complex workflows before individual competency
   - Additional specialized tools added
   - Multi-step processes across platforms

3. **Session 3**: **MANAGEABLE** ✅
   - Individual platform focus works well
   - 20-25 min blocks allow deeper processing

4. **Session 4**: **OPTIMAL** ✅
   - Synthesis and integration approach
   - Single project thread
